        description:'The specific trade occupation skills that once acquired will lead to the award of Certificate of Proficiency in Solar PV system and Electrical Installation trade. These respective modules have been organised in the form of Modules which are in themselves self-contained complete Basic Employable Skills Training (BEST) programs within the trade of Solar PV system and Electrical Installation. These modules can be offered and certified on their successful completion as single modules with the exception of module I that cuts across all the trades. The module one covers the issues surrounding specific trade theory, trade tools and equipment, occupational health and safety, fundamentals of trauma awareness, and understanding of competency based learning and its assessment criteria. The course comprises of nine modules of competen- cies with each module being a certifiable basic industry employable skill in the practice of occupation of Solar PV system and Electrical Installation. The course aims at formal, non-formal and informal training for persons who wish to acquire the right knowledge, attitude and skills, that will enable them to either engage in salaried employment in the profession of Solar PV system and Electrical Installation operating firms at junior level or be self-employed by managing their own business within the trade of Solar PV system and Electrical Installation. The course training curriculum has been designed and developed to achieve the objectives of providing multi-skilled workers for the occupation of Solar PV system and Electrical Installation industry in South Sudan and beyond.',
